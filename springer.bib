abstract = "Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is an enzyme of glycolysis that interconverts glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) but, outside the cell, is a multifunctional cytokine. High-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from mouse have been determined in native form and in complex with the inhibitor erythrose 4-phosphate, and with the substrate glucose 6-phosphate. In the substrate-bound structure, the glucose sugar is observed in both straight-chain and ring forms. This structure supports a specific role for Lys518 in enzyme-catalyzed ring opening and we present a ”push–pull” mechanism in which His388 breaks the O5–C1 bond by donating a proton to the ring oxygen atom and, simultaneously, Lys518 abstracts a proton from the \{C1\} hydroxyl group. The reverse occurs in ring closure. The transition from ring form to straight-chain substrate is achieved through rotation of the C3–C4 bond, which brings the C1–C2 region into close proximity to Glu357, the base catalyst for the isomerization step. The structure with \{G6P\} also explains the specificity of \{PGI\} for glucose 6-phosphate over mannose 6-isomerase (M6P). To isomerize \{M6P\} to \{F6P\} requires a rotation of its C2–C3 bond but in \{PGI\} this is sterically blocked by Gln511. "

abstract = "We introduce a new computability model, of a distributed parallel type, based on the notion of a membrane structure. Such a structure consists of several cell-like membranes, recurrently placed inside a unique “skin” membrane. A plane representation is a Venn diagram without intersected sets and with a unique superset. In the regions delimited by the membranes there are placed objects. These objects are assumed to evolve: each object can be transformed in other objects, can pass through a membrane, or can dissolve the membrane in which it is placed. A priority relation between evolution rules can be considered. The evolution is done in parallel for all objects able to evolve. In this way, we obtain a computing device (we call it a P system): start with a certain number of objects in a certain membrane and let the system evolve; if it will halt (no object can further evolve), then the computation is finished, with the result given as the number of objects in a specified membrane. If the development of the system goes forever, then the computation fails to have an output. We prove that the P systems with the possibility of objects to cooperate characterize the recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers; moreover, systems with only two membranes suffice. In fact, we do not need cooperating rules, but we only use catalysts, specified objects which are present in the rules but are not modified by the rule application. One catalyst suffices. A variant is also considered, with the objects being strings over a given alphabet. The evolution rules are now based on string transformations. We investigate the case when either the rewriting operation from Chomsky grammars (with respect to context-free productions) or the splicing operation from H systems investigated in the \{DNA\} computing is used. In both cases, characterizations of recursively enumerable languages are obtained by very simple P systems: with three membranes in the rewriting case and four in the splicing case. Several open problems and directions for further research are formulated "

abstract="In the attempt to have a framework where the computation is done by communication only, we consider the biological phenomenon of trans-membrane transport of couples of chemicals (one say symport when two chemicals pass together through a membrane, in the same direction, and antiport when two chemicals pass simultaneously through a membrane, in opposite directions). Surprisingly enough, membrane systems without changing (evolving) the used objects and with the communication based on rules of this type are computationally complete, and this result is achieved even for pairs of communicated objects (as encountered in biology). Five membranes are used; the number of membranes is reduced to two if more than two chemicals may collaborate when passing through membranes.",

We have previously developed an abstraction for biomolecular systems using the π-calculus process algebra, which successfully handled their molecular and biochemical aspects, but provided only a limited solution for representing compartments. In this work, we extend this abstraction to handle compartments. We are motivated by the ambient calculus, a process algebra for the specification of process location and movement through computational domains. We present the BioAmbients calculus, which is suitable for representing various aspects of molecular localization and compartmentalization, including the movement of molecules between compartments, the dynamic rearrangement of cellular compartments, and the interaction between molecules in a compartmentalized setting. Guided by the calculus, we adapt the BioSpi simulation system, to provide an extended modular framework for molecular and cellular compartmentalization, and we use it to model and study a complex multi-cellular system.

States of a machine are chemical solutions where floating molecules can interact according to reaction rules. Solutions can be stratified by encapsulating subsolutions within membranes that force reactions to occur locally. We illustrate the use of this model by describing the operational semantics of the TCCS and CCS process calculi and of the fragment of Milner, Parrow and Walker's Calculus of Mobile Processes used by Milner to encode the lambda-calculus. We also give ideas on how to extract a higher-order concurrent λ-calculus out of the basic concepts of the chemical abstract machine."

abstract = "Abstract This chapter surveys the semantic ramifications of extending traditional process algebras with notions of priority that allow some transitions to be given precedence over others. The need for these enriched formalisms arises when one wishes to model system features such as interrupts, prioritized choice, or real-time behavior. Approaches to priority in process algebras can be classified according to whether the induced notion of pre-emption on transitions is global or local and whether priorities are static or dynamic. Early work in the area concentrated on global pre-emption and static priorities and led to formalisms for modeling interrupts and aspects of real-time, such as maximal progress, in centralized computing environments. More recent research has investigated localized notions of pre-emption in which the distribution of systems is taken into account, as well as dynamic priority approaches. The latter allows priority values to change as systems evolve and enables an efficient encoding of real-time semantics. Technically, this chapter studies the different models of priorities by presenting extensions of Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) with static and dynamic priority as well as with notions of global and local pre-emption. For each extension, the operational semantics of \{CCS\} is modified appropriately, behavioral theories based on strong and weak bisimulation are given, and related approaches for other process-algebraic settings are discussed.

abstract = "Structured Operational Semantics (SOS) is a popular method for defining semantics by means of transition rules. An important feature of SOS rules is negative premises, which are crucial in the definitions of such phenomena as priority mechanisms and time-outs. However, the inclusion of negative premises in SOS rules also introduces doubts as to the preferred meaning of SOS specifications. Orderings on SOS rules were proposed by Phillips and Ulidowski as an alternative to negative premises. Apart from the definition of the semantics of positive GSOS rules with orderings, the meaning of more general types of SOS rules with orderings has not been studied hitherto. This paper presents several candidates for the meaning of general SOS rules with orderings and discusses their conformance to our intuition for such rules. We take two general frameworks (rule formats) for SOS with negative premises and SOS with orderings, and present semantics-preserving translations between them with respect to our preferred notion of semantics. Thanks to our semantics-preserving translation, we take existing congruence meta-results for strong bisimilarity from the setting of SOS with negative premises into the setting of SOS with orderings. We further compare the expressiveness of rule formats for SOS with orderings and SOS with negative premises. The paper contains also many examples that illustrate the benefits of SOS with orderings and the properties of the presented definitions of meaning."

This new feature allows one to control the order of application of rules when deriving transitions of process terms. Our method is powerful enough to deal with rules with negative premises and copying. We show that rules with orderings, called ordered SOS rules, have the same expressive power as GSOS rules. We identify several classes of process languages with operators defined by rules with and without orderings in the setting with silent actions and divergence. We prove that branching bisimulation and eager bisimulation relations are preserved by all operators in process languages in the relevant classes."

Recent studies about the inflammatory process of the brain that leads to multiple sclerosis have revealed that lymphocyte extravasation is a sequence of dynamical states, mediated by partially overlapped interactions of different adhesion molecules and activation factors. This study’s model of lymphocyte recruitment is based on process algebras for mobile systems. The biochemical system is modelled as a set of concurrent processes of the biochemical stochastic π-calculus. Processes are driven by suitable probability distributions that quantitatively describe the rates and the times at which reactions to simulations occur. The results of the model reproduce, within the estimated experimental errors, the functional behavior of the data obtained from laboratory measurements. }

Each model affords a different perspective of the pathway and analysis.

We then use the SPiM stochastic simulator to illustrate the practical interests of this description. The application example concerns the behaviors of four interacting genes involved in the $\lambda$-phage. Interesting results are emerging from the simulations. First, it confirms knowledge of the regulation phenomena. In addition, experiments with different values of the delay parameters give some precious hints of a tendency either for the lytic phase or to the lysogenic phase.",

These diagrams are fundamentally of two types: reaction graphs and activation/inhibition graphs. In this tutorial, we study these graphs with formal methods originating from programming theory. We consider systems of biochemical reactions with kinetic expressions, as written in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and interpreted in the Biochemical Abstract Machine (Biocham) at different levels of abstraction, by either an asynchronous boolean transition system, a continuous time Markov chain, or a system of Ordinary Differential Equations over molecular concentrations. We show that under general conditions satisfied in practice, the activation/inhibition graph is independent of the precise kinetic expressions, and is computable in linear time in the number of reactions. Then we consider the formalization of the biological properties of systems, as observed in experiments, in temporal logics. We show that these logics are expressive enough to capture semi-qualitative semi-quantitative properties of the boolean and differential semantics of reaction models, and that model-checking techniques can be used to validate a model w.r.t. its temporal specification, complete it, and search for kinetic parameter values. We illustrate this modelling method with examples on the MAPK signalling cascade, and on Kohn's map of the mammalian cell cycle.",

abstract = "Very simple reversible programming languages can be useful for the study of reversible transformations. For this purpose we define simple reversible language (SRL), a very simple reversible language, and analyse its properties. The language SRL is similar to the “loop” languages that have been used by several authors to characterise the set of primitive recursive functions. There are, however, important differences: SRL has domain Z instead of N and only reversible programs can be written in SRL. The reversibility of linear homogeneous SRL programs is related to the fact that the corresponding set of matrices has the algebraic structure of a group. We show that such programs implement exactly the linear transformations corresponding to the group of integer positive modular matrices, while in ESRL, an extended version of SRL, the set of transformations that can be implemented by linear homogeneous programs corresponds exactly to the group of integer modular matrices."

abstract = "Petri nets are a general formal model of concurrent systems which supports both action-based and state-based modelling and reasoning. One of important behavioural properties investigated in the context of Petri nets has been reversibility, understood as the possibility of returning to the initial marking from any reachable net marking. Thus reversibility in Petri nets is a global property. Reversible computation, on the other hand, is typically a local mechanism by which a system can undo some of the executed actions. This paper is concerned with the modelling of reversible computation within Petri nets. A key idea behind the proposed construction is to add ‘reverses’ of selected transitions, and the paper discusses its different implementations. Adding reverses can severely impact on the behaviour of a Petri net. Therefore it is important, in particular, to be able to determine whether the modified net has a similar set of states as the initial one. We first prove that the problem of establishing whether the initial and modified nets have the same reachable markings is undecidable, even in the restricted case considered in this paper. We then show that the problem of checking whether the reachability sets of the two nets cover the same markings is decidable."

In this paper we propose a reversible approach to Petri nets by introducing machinery and associated operational semantics to tackle the challenges of the three main forms of reversibility, namely, backtracking, causal reversing and out-of-causal-order reversing. Our proposal concerns a variation of Petri nets where tokens are persistent and are distinguished from each other by an identity. Our design decisions are influenced by applications in biochemistry but the methodology can be applied to a wide range of problems that feature reversibility. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with an example of a biochemical system and an example of a transaction-processing system both featuring reversible behaviour.",

abstract="Self-reconfigurable, modular robots are distributed mechatronic devices that can autonomously change their physical shape. Self-reconfiguration from one shape to another is typically achieved through a specific sequence of actuation operations distributed across the modules of the robot. Automatically reversing the sequence of operations brings the robot back to its initial shape, as has been experimentally demonstrated using the DynaRole reversible language. DynaRole however only allows simple sequences of operations to be reversed, which is suitable for reversing self-reconfiguration sequences but lacks the generality needed to implement more complex behaviors.",

In many such formalisms and calculi, the concepts of names, variables and binders are essential ingredients. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for dealing with names in SOS. The framework is based on the Nominal Logic of Gabbay and Pitts and hence is called Nominal SOS. We define nominal bisimilarity, an adaptation of the notion of bisimilarity that is aware of binding. We provide evidence of the expressiveness of the framework by formulating the early π-calculus and Abramskyʼs lazy λ-calculus within Nominal SOS. For both calculi we establish the operational correspondence with the original calculi. Moreover, in the context of the π-calculus, we prove that nominal bisimilarity coincides with Sangiorgiʼs open bisimilarity and in the context of the λ-calculus we prove that nominal bisimilarity coincides with Abramskyʼs applicative bisimilarity."
