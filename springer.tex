\section{Introduction}

General introduction, what we wanted to do and did.

\section{The autoprotolysis of water}

We consider a reaction that transfers a hydrogen atom between two water molecules. Since the
reaction takes place in water it is also known as \emph{autoprotolysis of water}. The reaction is shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis}. Here, $O$ indicates an oxygen atom and $H$ a hydrogen atom. The lines indicate bonds. Charges on atoms are shown by $\oplus$ and $\ominus$. The meaning of the curved arrows and the dots will be explained in the next paragraph. The reaction is reversible and it takes place at a relatively 
low rate, making pure water slightly conductive.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{autoprotolysis_corr3}
\caption{Autoprotolysis of water.}
\label{fig:autoprotolysis}
\end{figure}

In order to model this reaction we need to understand what it is that makes it happen.
The main factor is that the oxygen in the water molecule is \emph{nucleophilic}, meaning it has the tendency to bond to another atomic nucleus, which would serve as an \emph{electrophile}. This is because oxygen has a high 
electro-negativity, therefore it attracts electrons and has an abundance of electrons around it. The electrons around the atomic nucleus are arranged on electron shells, where only those in the outer shell participate in bonding. Oxygen has four electrons in its outer shell which are not involved in the initial bonding with hydrogen atoms. These electrons form two \emph{lone pair} of two electrons each, which can form new bonds (lone pairs are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis} by pairs of dots). All this makes oxygen nucleophilic: it tends to connect 
to other atomic nuclei by forming bonds from its lone pairs. Since oxygen attracts electrons, the hydrogen atoms in water
have a positive partial charge and oxygen a negative partial charge. The reaction
starts with the oxygen (in one water molecule) being attracted by a hydrogen in another 
water molecule due to their opposite
charges (this attraction is called a \emph{hydrogen bond}). Due to the nucleophilicity of 
the oxygen, a bond can form to the hydrogen. This bond is formed out of 
the electrons of one of the lone pairs of the oxygen. The curved arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis} indicate the movements of the electrons. Since a hydrogen atom cannot have more 
than one bond 
the creation of a new bond is compensated by breaking the existing hydrogen-oxygen bond (again indicated by a curved arrow). When this happens, both electrons, which form the hydrogen-oxygen bond, are left with oxygen. Since a hydrogen consists of one electron and one proton, it is only the proton that is transferred, so the process can be called a proton transfer as well as a hydrogen transfer. The forming of the new bond and the breaking of the old bond are \emph{concerted}, namely they happen together without a stable 
intermediate configuration. As a result we have reached the state where one oxygen atom
has three bonds to hydrogen atoms and is positively charged, represented on the right side of Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis}. This molecule is called hydronium and can be written as $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$. And the other oxygen atom bonds to only one hydrogen and is negatively charged, having an 
electron in surplus. This molecule is a hydroxide and can be written as $\mathrm{OH^-}$. 

We notice the reaction is reversible: the oxygen, which has lost a hydrogen, can 
pull back one of the hydrogens from the other molecule, the  $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ molecule. This is the case since the negatively 
charged oxygen is a strong nucleophile and the hydrogens in the $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ molecule are 
all positively charged. Therefore, any of the hydrogens 
%(not just the one which moved in the first instance) 
can be removed, making both oxygens formally uncharged, and restoring the two water 
molecules. In Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis} the curved arrows are given for the reaction going from left to right. Since the reaction is reversible (indicated by the double arrow) there are correspondent electron movements when going from right to left. These are not given in line with usual conventions, but can be inferred.

In this simple reaction, the forward and the reverse step consist of two steps each. It is not possible to say which of these happen first, since they occur simultaneously. This also means that there is no strict causality of actions, since none of them can be called the cause of the overall reaction.

\section{CCB}

In this chapter we introduce the Calculus of Covalent Bonding (CCB) \cite{KUHN201818} informally, concentrating on the new general 
prefixing operator $(s;b).P$ which produces pairs of \emph{concerted} actions,
while presenting an intuitive model of the autoprotolysis of water. This shows the strengths of CCB compared to previous calculi.

\subsection{Modelling the autoprotolysis of water in CCB}
\label{sec:simplemodel}



We shall model the hydrogen and oxygen atoms as processes $H$ and $O$ as follows, where 
$h,o$ are actions representing the bonding capabilities of the atoms and $n,p$ 
representing negative and positive charges, respectively. $H'$ and $O'$ are process constants.
$$\begin{array}{lll}
H & \bydef & (h;p).H'\\
O & \bydef & (o,o,n).O'
\end{array}$$
We use a general prefixing construct $(s;b).P$ where $s$ is a sequence of actions or executed 
actions, and $b$ is a \emph{weak} action. The prefixing operator must not used (as in the definition of $O$). In such a case at most one of the actions in the sequence can be a weak action. Informally, actions in $s$ can take place in any order 
and $b$ can happen if
all actions in $s$ have already taken place. Once $b$ takes place, it must be accompanied by
undoing immediately one of the actions in $s$. The weak action in the sequence, as we shall see later, is important for rewriting operations.  

We use a synchronisation function $\gamma$ which tells us which actions can combine to 
produce bonds between atoms. We define $\gamma$ in the style of ACP \cite{ACPBook}, 
where actions $ho, np, nh, no$ represent the created bonds and the communication function is a partial function $\gamma: \mathcal A \times \mathcal A \rightarrow \mathcal A$. :

$$\begin{array}{llllll}
\gamma(h,o) & = & ho \qquad &
\gamma(n,p) & = & np\\
\gamma(n,h) & = & nh &
\end{array}$$

Each water molecule is a structure consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom 
which are bonded appropriately. We shall use subscripts to name the individual copies of 
atoms and actions; for example $H_1$ is a specific copy of hydrogen defined by $(h_1;p).H'_1$, 
similarly for $O_1$ defined as $(o_1,o_2,n).O_1'$. The atoms are composed with 
the parallel composition operator ``$\mid$'' using the communication keys
(which are natural numbers) to combine actions into bonds. So a water molecule is modelled
by the following process, where the key $1$ shows that $h_1$ of $H_1$ has bonded with
$o_1$ of $O_1$ (correspondingly for key $2$). The restriction $\setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\} $ ensures that these actions cannot happen on their own, but only together with their partners, forming a bond.
$$ ((h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1)
  \setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\} $$
The system of two water molecules in Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis} is represented 
by the parallel composition of two water processes, where the restriction $\setminus\{n,p\}$ represses actions $n,p$ from taking place separately
by forcing them to combine into bonds (according to $\gamma$).
%
\begin{flalign*}
&(( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1)\setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\} \paral &&\\
&( (h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2) \setminus\{h_3,h_4,o_3,o_4\} ) \setminus\{n,p\}&&
\end{flalign*}
%
Following a general principle in process calculi in the style of CCB we can move the restritions to the outside. The rule used can be written as $(P \paral Q) \setminus L = P \setminus L \paral Q$ if the actions of $L$ are not used in $Q$. Applying this gives us a water molecule modelled as follows:
%
\begin{flalign*}
&( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1) \paral (h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral &&\\
&(h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2) ) \setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\}\setminus\{h_3,h_4,o_3,o_4\}\setminus\{n,p\}&&
\end{flalign*}
%
Note the $\underline{h_i}$, $\underline{o_j}$, and $\underline{n}$ are not restricted:  this allows us to break bonds via concerted actions involving these actions. We will see an example of this in the next step.

Notice that we leave out the restrictions to improve readability in the following description.

Now actions $n$ in $O_1$ and $p$ in $H_3$ can combine (we use the new key $5$), representing a transfer of a proton from one atom 
of oxygen ($O_2$ in our model) to another one ($O_1$ in our model). Since a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron, and the electron stays in such a transfer, it can either be called a proton transfer or the transfer of a (positively charged) hydrogen atoms. We show the transfer from $O_2$ to $O_1$, where $\xrightarrow{}$
is a transition relation denoting a reaction taking place, here a creation of a bond (changes highlighted in \textbf{bold}):
\begin{flalign*}
&(h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1) \paral &&\\
&(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2)&&\\
&\xrightarrow{}&&\\
&(h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n\boldsymbol{[5]}).O'_1 \paral (h_3[3];p\boldsymbol{[5]}).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2&&
\end{flalign*}
The creation of the bond with key $5$ forces us to break the bond with key $3$ (between $h_3$ and
$o_3$) due to the property of the operator $(s;b).P$ discussed earlier:
\begin{flalign*}
&(h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1) \paral &&\\
&(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2)&&\\
&\xrightarrow{}&&\\
&(h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n[5]).O'_1 \paral (\boldsymbol{h_3};p[5]).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (\boldsymbol{o_3},o_4[4],n).O'_2&&
\end{flalign*}
These two reactions happen almost simultaneously so we represent them as a pair of 
\emph{concerted actions}. In line with the convention in process calculi, where the action performed is written above the transition arrow, we write a pair of reactions above the transition arrow, to express the concerted actions. We enclose them in $\{\}$ to indicate concerted actions.
\begin{flalign*}
& (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral 
(h_3[3];p).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2) &&\\
&\xrightarrow{\{ np[5], \underline{h_{3}o_{3}}[3]\}}&&\\
&( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n\boldsymbol{[5]}).O'_1 \paral 
(\boldsymbol{h_3};p\boldsymbol{[5]}).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (\boldsymbol{o_3},o_4[4],n).O'_2&&
\end{flalign*}
We have now arrived at the state on the right hand side in Figure~\ref{fig:autoprotolysis}.
There are weak bonds between $n$ and $p$ (denoted by key $5$) and \emph{strong} bonds between $h_i$ and $o_j$ for
all appropriate $i,j$. Since $H_3$ is weakly bonded to $O_1$ and its strong capability 
$h_3$ has become available, the bond $5$ gets promoted to the stronger bond, releasing 
the capability $p$ of $H_3$. We represent this change as a rewrite denoted by $\Rightarrow$
(which is not as a transition) and we obtain the following process:
\begin{flalign*}
&( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n\boldsymbol{[5]}).O'_1 \paral 
(\boldsymbol{h_3};p\boldsymbol{[5]}).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (\boldsymbol{o_3},o_4[4],n).O'_2 &&\\
&\Rightarrow( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n[5]).O'_1) \paral (h_3\boldsymbol{[5]};\boldsymbol{p}).H'_3) &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3,o_4[4],n).O'_2&&
\end{flalign*}
Oxygen $O_1$ is still blocked, which represents it being fully bonded (and positively charged).
Oxygen  $O_2$ has a free $n$ capability and can remove any of the hydrogens from $O_1$. 
As a result the process can reverse to its original state.

We show this by again transferring $H_3$. We then execute promotion again:
%
\begin{flalign*}
&(( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n[5]).O'_1) \paral (h_3[5];p).H'_3) &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3,o_4[4],n).O'_2&&\\
&\xrightarrow{\{ np[3], \underline{nh_{3}}[5]\}}&&\\
&(( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],\boldsymbol{n}).O'_1) \paral (\boldsymbol{h_3};\boldsymbol{p[3]}).H'_3) &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3,o_4[4],\boldsymbol{n[3]}).O'_2\\
&\Rightarrow\\
&(( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],\boldsymbol{n}).O'_1) \paral (\boldsymbol{h_3[3]};\boldsymbol{p}).H'_3) &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (\boldsymbol{o_3[3]},o_4[4],\boldsymbol{n}).O'_2
\end{flalign*}
%
This corresponds to the original process, which we started with, after moving the restrictions to the outside. Remember that we left out the restrictions only to improve readability. If we re-add them we get:
%
\begin{flalign*}
&( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral (h_3[3];p).H'_3 &&\\
&\paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2) \setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\}\setminus\{h_3,h_4,o_3,o_4\}\setminus\{n,p\}&&
\end{flalign*}
%
We can therefore apply the movement of restrictions the reverse way we applied it originally and get:
%
\begin{flalign*}
&(( (h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1)\setminus\{h_1,h_2,o_1,o_2\} \paral &&\\
&( (h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2) \setminus\{h_3,h_4,o_3,o_4\} ) \setminus\{n,p\}&&
\end{flalign*}
%
\subsection{Chemically equivalent processes}
%
So far we have chosen a particular hydrogen atom to transfer. It would be equally possible to use any other hydrogen. Since we have marked our actions and processes by subscript numbers, we are able to distinguish the various situations here. Furthermore, the use of keys is arbitrary and many more syntactically different processes can be generated by using different keys. If we disregard different keys linking the same actions, but annotate actions and processes by subscripts, we can distinguish the processes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:allwater}. In Figure~\ref{fig:allwaterprocesses} the processes are shown in a graph with the possible transitions. The numbers in Figure~\ref{fig:allwaterprocesses} correspond to those in Figure~\ref{fig:allwater}.

%
From a chemical point of view there are only two possible configurations, namely a system of two water molecules (processes 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 14 in Figure~\ref{fig:allwater}) and a system of one $H_3O^+$ and one $HO^-$ molecule (processes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, and 13 in Figure~\ref{fig:allwater}). Processes 6, 7, 8, and 9 have two hydrogens swapped between the oxygens, and process 14 has all hydrogens swapped between the oxygens. 

In order to model this equality in our calculus, we need two operations, which we discuss informally here. Firstly, we must be able to change a key in the process to some other fresh key. The new key must not be used in the process so far. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:allwaterprocesses} process 5 is: 
\begin{flalign*}
&(h_1[5];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1,o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\  &(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n[5]).O'_2)&&
\end{flalign*}
From this process we can transition to process 6 in Figure~\ref{fig:allwaterprocesses}. This would happen by the following transition and promotion:
\begin{flalign*}
&(h_1[5];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1,o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\  &(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n[5]).O'_2)&&\\
&\xrightarrow{\{np[6],\underline{h_4n}[4]\}}\Tran{}&&\\
&(h_1[5];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[6],o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\  &(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[6];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[5],n).O'_2)&&
\end{flalign*}
On the other hand, Figure~\ref{fig:allwaterprocesses} tells us that process 6 is actually as follows (this was derived by a transition from process 3, which leads to process 6 as well):
\begin{flalign*}
& (h_1[6];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[5],o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\ 
& (h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[5];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[6],n).O'_2)&&
\end{flalign*}
If we swap keys 5 and 6, these processes are syntactically identical (swapping is a short name for changing both keys to the other key via a third variable to avoid conflicts). Clearly this is possible, since as long as keys link the same actions, their naming is arbitrary. Figure~\ref{fig:allwater} implies several such changes in order for the transitions to be valid.

Secondly, we can also disregard subscripts (which were introduced to distinguish copies of atoms of the same type). Informally we can say that if we remove the subscripts on the actions and process names and change keys accordingly, then only two processes can be distinguished. In \cite{mediss} we called this chemical process equivalence. To demonstrate this we use processes 1 and 14. Process 1 is
\begin{flalign*}&(h_1[1];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[1],o_2[2],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\ &(h_3[3];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[4];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[3],o_4[4],n).O'_2&&\end{flalign*}
and becomes (with keys and order of processes unchanged):
\begin{flalign*}
&(h[1];p).H' \paral (h[2];p).H' \paral (o[1],o[2],n).O' \paral &&\\
&(h[3];p).H' \paral (h[4];p).H'  \paral (o[3],o[4],n).O'&& (1)\end{flalign*}
Process 14 is 
\begin{flalign*}
&(h_1[6];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[8];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[5],o_2[7],n).O'_1 \paral &&\\
&(h_3[5];p).H'_3 \paral (h_4[7];p).H'_4  \paral (o_3[6],o_4[8],n).O'_2)\end{flalign*}
and becomes (with keys 6, 8, 5, 7 being changed to 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively and the two processes representing oxygen atoms being swapped)
\begin{flalign*}
&(h[1];p).H' \paral (h[2];p).H' \paral (o[1],o[2],n).O') \paral &&\\ 
&(h[3];p).H' \paral (h[4];p).H' \paral (o[3],o[4],n).O'&&(2)
\end{flalign*}
As we can see the resulting processes (1) and (2) are syntactically identical.

On the one hand, he subscripts allow us to distinguish cases which would otherwise be written identically. On the other hand, the naming of keys has no semantic meaning. Overall there are two possible states in a system of two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms if keys and subscripts are disregarded completly, 14 different states if subscripts are taken into account (these states are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:allwater}), and an infinite number of states if keys from $\mathbb{N}$ are considered different.

\begin{example}\label{auto-bonding-water}
{\rm 
Note that in water the $n$ of $O_1$ can combine with the $p$ of one of its hydrogen atoms, say 
$H_1$. Due to the property of the operator $(h_1[1];p).H'_1$, this must be followed immediately
by breaking the bond 1 on $h_1$ with $O_1$, giving 
$$( (h_1;p[5]).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1,o_2[2],n[5]).O'_1) ) 
\; \setminus\{h_1,h_2,h_3,o_1,o_2\}.$$
Now the system is converted to a system which is equivalent to the original formulation of water by promoting the bond 5 to a strong bond:
$$( (h_1[5];p).H'_1 \paral (h_2[2];p).H'_2 \paral (o_1[5],o_2[2],n).O'_1) )                         
\; \setminus\{h_1,h_2,h_3,o_1,o_2\}$$
So our calculus allows a reaction which does not change the actual state of the system. We have replaced the original key $1$ with a new key $5$, but this change is not indicating an actual change in the system.
}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}\label{types-of-bonds}
{\rm
It should be noted that there are two types of bonding modelled here. Firstly, we have the initial bonds where two atoms contribute an electron each. Secondly, the \emph{dative or coordinate bonds} are formed where both electrons come from one atom (an oxygen in this case). Both are \emph{covalent bonds}, and once formed they cannot be distinguished. Specifically, in the oxygen with three bonds all bonds are the same and no distinction can be made. If one of the bonds is broken by a deprotonation (as in the autoprotolysis of water) the two electrons are left behind and they form a lone pair. If the broken bond was not previously formed as a dative bond, the electrons changed their ``r\^{o}le''. This is done in our modelling by promoting the bond from the $n$ action to the $o$ action. For the hydrogen we have a similar situation: Once the proton transfer has happened, the new bond is the same as the old one, so we perform the promotion. We can have only one bond at a time on the hydrogen, therefore we need the ; operator to model this situation, whereas the oxygen can have two or three bonds, so we model all bonds as a multiset.
}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Conclusion}

We have seen in this chapter that we can model a simple covalent chemical reaction using CCB. In particular, when modelling the autoprotolysis of water, we can include the concerted reaction and we can model that the reverse reaction can work on any of the hydrogens, not just the one transferred in the forward step. CCB can also be used to model situations beyond simple chemical reactions  \cite{merevcomp2018}.

\section{Bonding Calculus}

In this section we present shortly the bonding calculus \cite{NaCo18}, and 
illustrate its expressiveness by modelling the autoprotolysis of water. 
Let us consider the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers, the set 
$\mN=\{x,x^+,x^-,\dots\}$ of bond names, the set $\mM=\{a,b,\dots\}$ of 
molecules and the set $\mP=\{P,Q,\ldots\}$ of processes. A multiset over 
$\mN$ is defined as a partial function $N:\mN \rightarrow \N$. In bonding 
calculus each molecule has an unique name, and the bond $x$ between two 
molecules $a$ and $b$ is denoted by $\{a-^x b\}$.

The bonding calculus syntax is presented in Table \ref{table:syntax}.

\end{table}
\vspace{-3ex}

A bond prefix $\overline{x}(b)$ is used to indicate the availability of 
molecule with name~$b$ to create a new bond with name $x$, while an unbond 
prefix $\underline{x}(b)$ indicates the availability of $b$ to destroy an 
existing bond $x$. The process of creating or breaking a bond leads to an 
update of the global bond memory $L$. Since several similar bonds can exist 
between the same molecules, $L$ is actually a multiset of bonds.

The process $\textbf{0}$ denotes inactivity. The availability to perform an 
action $\alpha$, and then to continue the execution as process $P$ is denoted 
by the process $\alpha.P$. The process $P+Q$ offers a choice 
between the processes $P$ and $Q$, while the process $P \mid Q$ allows the 
execution of processes $P$ and $Q$ in parallel, with possible interactions 
between them by using appropriate actions.

As we work with bonds, we use the function $\Bumpeq: \mathcal{M}\times 
\N^{\mN} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow Bool$ to check if between two 
molecules exist certain bonds. For example, $a\Bumpeq^N b$ checks for the 
existence of all bonds in $N$ between the molecules $a$ and $b$; it 
returns true when such bonds exist, and false otherwise. When we consider 
$N=\emptyset$, then $a\Bumpeq^{\emptyset}b$ checks if at least a bond 
exists between the two molecules. When $b=\varepsilon$, then $a\Bumpeq^N 
{\varepsilon}$ checks if $a$ has all of bonds from $N$, regardless of 
the molecules he has them with. The Boolean result $a \Bumpeq^N b$ used 
in the testing process is defined formally as:
\smallskip

$a \Bumpeq^N b=\begin{cases}
\displaystyle(\biguplus_{x \in N} \{a-^x b\}) \in L & N \neq \emptyset~and ~a \neq b \neq \varepsilon\\
\displaystyle(\biguplus_{x \in \mN} \{a-^x b\}) \cap L \neq \emptyset & N = \emptyset~and ~a \neq b \neq \varepsilon\\
\displaystyle\bigwedge_{x \in N} (|L|_{a,x}=|N|_x) & N \neq \emptyset~and ~a \neq \varepsilon ~and~b = \varepsilon\\
undefined & otherwise,
\end{cases}$

\noindent where $|L|_{a,x}$ is the number of bonds containing the molecule 
$a$ and bond name~$x$ that appear in the multiset $L$, while $|N|_x$ is 
the number of occurrences of~$x$ in~$N$.

Depending on the truth value of $a \Bumpeq^N\!\! b $, the process 
$\textbf{if}\;a \Bumpeq^N\!\! b$ $\;\textbf{then}\;P\;\textbf{else}\;Q$ 
executes either $P$ or $Q$.  An identifier $ A(b_1,\ldots,b_n) $ is used 
to provide recursion by creating new instances of processes defined as 
$A(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=P$, where $a_i \neq a_j$ for all $i\neq j \in 
\{1,\ldots,n\}$; the new process is defined as $ A(b_1,\ldots,b_n) 
=P\{b_1/a_1,\ldots,b_n/a_n\}$, where $\{b_i/a_i\}$ denotes the replacement 
of variable $a_i$ by value $b_i$. A system $S$ is given as a parallel 
composition of a process $P$ and the multiset of bonds $L$.
\smallskip

The structural congruence relation $\equiv$ is the least congruence such 
that $(\mP,+,{\bf 0})$ and $(\mP,\mid,{\bf 0})$ are commutative monoids 
and the unfolding law $A(b_1,\ldots,b_n) \equiv 
P\{b_1/a_1,\ldots,b_n/a_n\}$ holds whenever $A(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ = $P$.

The calculus presented in \cite{NaCo18} was intended to model only the 
creation and breaking of the covalent bonds. In order to be able to model 
both covalent and hydrogen bonds, we apply a minor update to the 
operational semantic in \cite{NaCo18} because we need two instances of the 
rules used to create and to break bonds. The only difference between the 
two instances of the same rule is given by the names of the bonds 
appearing in the interacting processes, and by the fact that a bond cannot 
be created using the names $x^+$ and $x^-$ if other bonds exist between 
the same molecules; more details about this restriction will be given in 
the example below.

The operational semantics of the bonding calculus is given in Table~\ref{table:semantics}.

The rules {\sf (CREATE1)} and {\sf (CREATE2)} describe the creation of a 
new bond $\{a-^x b\}$, while the rules {\sf (REMOVE1)} and {\sf (REMOVE2)} 
describe the breaking of a bond $\{a-^x b\}$; if there exist two bonds 
$\{a-^x b\}$ in~$L$, then any of the these bonds is broken. The rule 
{\sf (PAR}) is used to compose processes in parallel, while the rules 
{\sf (TRUE}) and {\sf (FALSE}) choose one of the branches of the testing 
process based on the result of the checking. The rule {\sf (IDE)} describes 
the recursion, while {\sf (STRUCT)} rule indicates the fact that we reason 
up to the structural congruence.

\begin{example}
We illustrate the expressiveness of the bonding calculus by modelling the 
autoprotolysis of water. We use two types of bond names, namely $c$ and $h$, 
to stand for the covalent and hydrogen bonds, respectively. Using our  
calculus, the system composed of two molecules of water is described by:

\centerline{$\MolOxy_2(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid \MolOxy_2(O_2) \mid \MolHy_1(H_3) \mid \MolHy_1(H_4) $}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_2 -^c H_3, O_2 -^c H_4\}$,}

\noindent 
where the molecules are those of hydrogen and oxygen that are described below:

$\MolHy_0(H_i) = \overline{c}(H_i).\MolHy_1(H_i)$;

$\MolHy_1(H_i) = \underline{c}(H_i).\MolHy_0(H_i) + \overline{h^+}(H_i).\MolHy_2(H_i)$;

$\MolHy_2(H_i) = \underline{c}(H_i).\overline{c}(H_i).\underline{h^+}(H_i).\MolHy_{1}(H_i)$.

$\MolOxy_0(O_i) = \overline{c}(O_i).\MolOxy_1(O_i)$;

$\MolOxy_1(O_i) = \underline{c}(O_i).\MolOxy_0(O_i) +\overline{c}(O_i).\MolOxy_2(O_i)$;

$\MolOxy_2(O_i) = \underline{c}(O_i).\MolOxy_1(O_i) +\overline{h^-}(O_i).\MolOxy_3(O_i)$.

$\MolOxy_3(O_i) = \underline{h^-}(O_i).\MolOxy_2(O_i)$.

\noindent 
Each molecule of water is a structure consisting of one molecule of oxygen 
and two molecules of hydrogen which are properly bonded. E.g., the process 
$\MolOxy_2(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy(H_2) $ together with the 
bonds $\{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2\}$ model one molecule of water. We use 
unique names for the molecules given as $O_i$ (for oxygen) and $H_i$ (for 
hydrogen), while the processes having the names $\MolHy_i$ and $\MolOxy_i$ 
identify processes modelling hydrogen and oxygen molecules with~$i$ bonds, 
respectively. E.g., the process $MolOxy_1(O_i)$ can either create or break 
bonds, and this is why we use the operator $+$ to describe such a  
(non-deterministic) choice.

Now we present the steps of one of the possible reactions modelling the 
autoprotolysis of water. The system of two molecules of water can be 
rewritten as follows (where we extend the definitions for the processes 
that will interact in the next step, and bold the actions to be executed):\\

\centerline{$\underline{c}(O_1).\MolOxy_1(O_1) +{\bf \overline{h^-}(O_1)}.
\MolOxy_3(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid \MolOxy_2(O_2) \mid \MolHy_1(H_3) \mid \underline{c}(H_4).
\MolHy_0(H_4) + {\bf \overline{h^+}(H_4)}.\MolHy_2(H_4)$}

%\centerline{$\mid \underline{c}(H_4).\MolHy_0(H_4) + {\bf \overline{h^+}(H_4)}.\MolHy_2(H_4)$}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_2 -^c H_3, O_2 -^c H_4\}$.}

\noindent 
This leads to the following system, where we again bold the processes to be~executed:

\centerline{$\MolOxy_3(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid {\bf \underline{c}(O_2)}.\MolOxy_1(O_2) +\overline{h^-}(O_2).\MolOxy_3(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_3)$}

\centerline{$ \mid {\bf \underline{c}(H_4)}.\overline{c}(H_4).\underline{h^+}(H_4).\MolHy_{1}(H_4)$}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_1-^h H_4,O_2 -^c H_3, O_2 -^c H_4\}$.}

\noindent 
The creation of the hydrogen bond forces the break of the other bond in 
which the hydrogen molecule $H_4$ is involved. This leads to the following
system containing the $H_3O$ and $HO$ molecules:

\centerline{$\MolOxy_3(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid \underline{c}(O_2).\MolOxy_0(O_2) +{\bf \overline{c}(O_2)}.\MolOxy_2(O_2)$}

\centerline{$ \mid \MolHy_1(H_3)$ $ \mid {\bf \overline{c}(H_4)}.\underline{h^+}(H_4).\MolHy_{1}(H_4)$}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_1-^h H_4,O_2 -^c H_3\}$.}

\noindent 
Since some bonds are weaker, the system is evolving to:

\centerline{${\bf \underline{h^-}(O_1)}.\MolOxy_2(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid \MolOxy_2(O_2)$ $ \mid \MolHy_1(H_3)$ $ \mid {\bf \underline{h^+}(H_4)}.\MolHy_{1}(H_4)$}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_1-^h H_4,O_2 -^c H_3, O_2 -^c H_4\}$,}

\noindent 
followed by the breaking of the hydrogen bond $O_1-^h H_4$:

\centerline{$\MolOxy_2(O_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_1) \mid \MolHy_1(H_2) $}

\centerline{$\mid \MolOxy_2(O_2)$ $ \mid \MolHy_1(H_3)$ $ \mid \MolHy_{1}(H_4)$}

\centerline{$\mid\mid \{O_1 -^c H_1, O_1 -^c H_2, O_2 -^c H_3, O_2 -^c H_4\}$}

\noindent 
The obtained system contains again two water molecules of water.
\end{example}

Therefore, the bonding calculus is suitable for modelling in a 
natural and easy way the autoprotolysis of water.


\section{Reversing Petri nets}
In this section we present reversing Petri nets (RPNs), an extension of Petri nets
developed for modeling reversing computations, and we employ the formalism
to model the autoprotolysis of water. Reversing Petri nets~\cite{RPNs} are 
Petri net structures that allow transitions to be reversed. They assume 
tokens to be distinguished from each other by an identity/type and to be persistent. Furthermore,
during transitions tokens can be bonded with each other. The creation of bonds
is considered to be the effect of a transition, whereas their destruction is the effect of
the transition's reversal. RPNs
have been extended with a mechanism for controlling transition
reversal by associating transitions with conditions~\cite{CRPNs}. In this section we consider
a model allowing multiple tokens of the same type as well as the possibility for 
transitions to break bonds. Thus, a transition may simultaneously create
and destruct bonds, and its reversal results in the opposite effect. Formally, a RPN
is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}{\rm
		A \emph{\PN}(RPN) is a tuple $(P,T,  A, A_V, B, F)$ where:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $P$ is a finite set of \emph{places} and
			$T$ is a finite set of \emph{transitions}.
			\item $A$ is a finite set of \emph{base} or \emph{token types} ranged over by $a, b,\ldots$.
			$\overline{A} = 
			\{\overline{a}\mid a\in A\}$ contains a ``negative"  version for each token type. We assume that
			for any token type $a$ there may exist a finite number of \emph{token instances}. 
			We write $a_1,\ldots,$ for
			instances of type $a$ and $A_I$ for the set of all token instances. 
			\item $A_V$ is a finite set of \emph{token variables}. We write $\type(v)$ for the type
			of variable $v$ and assume that $\type(v) \in A$ for all $v\in A_V$.
			\item $B\subseteq A\times A$ is a finite set of undirected \emph{bond} types ranged over
			by $\beta,\gamma,\ldots$. We use the notation $a \bond b$ for a bond $(a,b)\in B$.  
			$\overline{B} = \{\overline{\beta}\mid \beta\in B\}$ contains a ``negative" version for 
			each bond type. $B_I\subseteq A_I\times A_I$ is a finite set of \emph{bond instances},
			where we write $\beta_i$ 
			for elements of $B$.
			\item $F : (P\times T  \cup T \times P)\rightarrow {\cal P}( A_V \cup (A_V \times A_V) \cup \overline{A}
			\cup \overline{B}) $ 
			is a set of directed labelled \emph{arcs}.
		\end{enumerate}
}\end{definition}

Thus, a reversing Petri net is built on the basis of a set of \emph{tokens} or \emph{bases}. These
are organized in a set of token types $A$, where each token type is associated with a set of token instances.
Token instances correspond to the basic entities that occur in a system and they may occur as 
stand-alone elements but as computation proceeds they may also merge together to form \emph{bond 
	instances}. 
Places and transitions have the standard meaning and are connected
via directed arcs which are labelled by a set of elements from $A_V \cup (A_V \times A_V) \cup \overline{A}
\cup \overline{B}$.  Intuitively, these labels express the requirements for a transition
to fire when placed on arcs incoming the transition, and the effects of the transition when placed on the
outgoing arcs. 
Graphically, a RPN is portrayed as a directed bipartite graph where token instances are indicated by $\bullet$, places by
circles, transitions by boxes, and bond instances by lines between token instances. 
\begin{figure}[t]

	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{model.png}
	\caption{RPN model of the autoprotolysis of water}
	\label{RPNmodel}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{RPNmodel} depicts the graphical representation of the RPN model for the autoprotolysis of water.
In this model, we assume two token types, $H$ for hydrogen
and $O$ for oxygen. They are instantiated via four token instances of $H$ ($H_1$, $H_2$, $H_3$, and $H_4$) and two token instances of
$O$, ($O_1$ and $O_2$). The net consists of five places and three transitions and the edges between
them are associated with token variables and bonds, where we assume that $\type(o)=\type(o_1)=\type(o_2) = O$
and $\type(h)=\type(h_1)=\type(h_2)=\type(h_3)=\type(h_4)=H$. 
Looking at the transitions, transition $t_1$ models the formation of a bond between a hydrogen
token and an oxygen token. Precisely, the transition stipulates a selection of two such
molecules with the use
of variables $o$ and $h$ on the incoming arcs of the transition which are bonded
together, as described in the outgoing arc of the transition.
Subsequently, transition $t_2$ completes
the formation of a water molecule by selecting an oxygen token from place $x$ and
a hydrogen token from place $v$ and forming a bond between them, placing the resulting component at place $y$. Note that the selected oxygen instance in this transition will be connected to a hydrogen token via a bond 
created by transition $t_1$; this bond is preserved and the component resulting from the creation of
the new $o-h$ bond will be transferred to place $y$. (Details about execution of the model will follow the
description of RPN semantics.)
Finally, transition $t_3$ models the autoprotolysis reaction: assuming the existence of two distinct oxygen
instances, as required by the variables $o_1$ and $o_2$ on the incoming arc of the transition, connected
with hydrogen instances as speficied in $F(y,t_3)$, the transition breaks the bond $o_2-h_3$ and forms the
bond  $o_1-h_3$.  As such, assuming the existence of two water molecules at place $y$, the transition
will form  a hydronium  (H$_3^+$O) and a hydroxin (OH$^-$) molecule in place $z$ of the net.
The reversibility semantics of RPNs ensures that  reversing the transition $t_3$ will result in the re-creation
of  two water molecules placed at $y$, while the use of variables allows the formation of water molecules consisting
of different bondings between the hydrogen and oxygen instances, as will be explained in the sequel.


In order to introduce the semantics of RPNs we need to introduce some notations. Note that in 
the sequel we omit the discussion of negative tokens and negative bonds as they are not relevant to our
case study. We also restrict  our attention to causal reversibility which allows some simplifications
of the exposition and, in particular, of the history function defined below.
We write 
$\circ t =   \{x\in P\mid  F(x,t)\neq \emptyset\}$ and  
$ t\circ = \{x\in P\mid F(t,x)\neq \emptyset\}$
for the incoming and outgoing places of transition
$t$, respectively. Furthermore, we write
$\guard{t}  =   \bigcup_{x\in P} F(x,t)$ 
for the union of all labels on the
incoming arcs of  transition $t$, 
and $\effects{t}  =   \bigcup_{x\in P} F(t,x)$
for the union of all labels on the 
outgoing arcs of transition $t$. 
\begin{definition}\label{well-formed}{\rm 
		A \PN is \emph{well-formed}, if for all $t\in T$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $A_V\cap \guard{t} = A_V\cap \effects{t}$,
			\item $ F(t,x)\cap F(t,y)\cap A_V=\emptyset$ for all $x,y\in P$, $x\neq y $. 
		\end{enumerate}
}\end{definition}
Thus, a \PN is well-formed if (1) whenever a variable exists in
the ingoing arcs of a transition then it also exists on the outgoing arcs, which implies that transitions do not
erase tokens, and  (2) 
tokens/bonds cannot be cloned into more than one outgoing places.

As with standard Petri nets the association of token/bond instances to places is called a \emph{marking}  such that 
$M: P\rightarrow 2^{A_I\cup B_I}$, where we assume that if $(u,v)\in M(x)$ then $u, v\in M(x)$. 
In addition, we employ the notion of a \emph{history}, which assigns a memory to each
transition $H : T\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. 
Intuitively, a history of $H(t) = 0$ for some $t \in T$ captures that the transition has not taken place, or 
every execution of it has been reversed, and a history
of $ H(t)=k, k>0$, captures that the transition was executed  $k$ times that have not been  reversed.
Note that $H(t)>1$ may
arise due to the consecutive execution of the transition with different token
instances. A pair of a marking and a history, $\state{M}{H}$, describes a \emph{state} of a RPN 
with $\state{M_0}{H_0}$ the initial state, where $H_0(t) = 0$ for all $t\in T$. 

Finally, we define $\connected(a_i,C)$, where $a_i\in A_I$ and $C\subseteq 2^{A_I\cup B_I}$,
to be the tokens connected
to $a_i$  as well as the bonds creating these connections according to 
set $C$. 

\paragraph{Forward Execution.}
During the forward execution of a transition in a RPN, 
a set of tokens and bonds, as specified by the incoming arcs of the transition, are selected and
moved to the outgoing places of the transition, as specified by the transition's outgoing arcs, possibly
forming or destructing bonds, as necessary. Given, however, the presence of multiple instances of the same token
type, it is possible that different token instances are selected during the transition's execution.  


A transition is forward-enabled in a state $\state{M}{H}$ of a \PN if there exists a selection of token instances 
available at the incoming places of the transition that 
match the requirements  on the transitions incoming arcs. Formally:

\begin{definition}\label{fenabled}{\rm
		Given a \RPN $(P,T, A, A_V, B, F)$, a state $\state{M}{H}$, and a transition $t$, we say that $t$ is 
		\emph{forward-enabled} in $\state{M}{H}$  if there exists a surjective function 
		$U:\guard{t}\cap A_V\rightarrow A_I$ such that:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  for all $v\in\guard{t}$, if $\type(v) = a$	then $\type(U(v))=a$
			\item for all $a\in F(x,t)$, then $U(a)\in M(x)$ and for all $(a,b)\in F(x,t)$, then $(U(a),U(b))\in M(x)$, 
			\item for all
			$(a,b)\in \effects{t}-\guard{t}$ then $(U(a),U(b))\not\in M(x)$ for all $x\in\circ t$.
		\end{enumerate}
}\end{definition}

Thus, $t$ is enabled in state $\state{M}{H}$ if  (1,2) there is a type-respecting assignment of token instances
to the variables on the incoming edges, with the token instances originating from the appropriate
input places of the transition and  connected with
bonds as required by the variable bonds occurring on the incoming edges, and (3) if a bond
occurs in the outgoing edges of the transition but not the incoming ones, then the selected instances
associated with the bond's variables should not be bonded together in the incoming places
of the transition (thus transitions do not recreate bonds). We refer to $U$ as a forward enabling 
assignment.

To execute a transition $t$ according to an enabling assignment $U$, 
the selected token instances, along with their connected components,
are relocated to the outgoing places of the transition as specified
by the outgoing arcs, with bonds created and destructed accordingly. 
Furthermore,
the history of the executed transition is increased by one. Specifically,
we define:
\begin{definition}{\rm \label{forward}
		Given a \RPN $(P,T,  A, A_V, B, F)$, a state $\langle M, H\rangle$, and an
		enabling assignment $U$, we write $\state{M}{H}
		\trans{t} \state{M'}{H'}$
		where for all $x\in P$:
		\[
		M'(x) =   M(x)- \bigcup_{a\in f(x,t)} \connected(U(a), M(x)) 
		\cup  \bigcup_{a\in f(t,x),U(a)\in M(y))} \connected(U(a),S)\]
		where $S= (M(y)
		-\{(U(a),U(b))\mid (a,b)\in F(y,t)\})\cup \{ (U(a),U(b))\mid (a,b)\in F(t,x) \}$
		\[
		\hspace{0.2in}\mbox{and}\hspace{0.2in}
		H'(t') = \left\{
		\begin{array}{ll}
		H(t')+1, \hspace{1cm} \textrm{ if } t' = t  \; \\
		H(t'), \hspace{1.5cm}  \;\textrm{ otherwise }
		\end{array}
		\right.			\]	
}\end{definition} 


\paragraph{Reversing Execution.}
We now move on to  reversing transitions. 
A transition can be reversed in a certain state if it has been previously executed and there exist token instances in its output places 
that match the requirements on its outgoing arcs. Specifically, we define the notion of reverse enabledness
as follows.
\begin{definition}\label{renabled}{\rm
		Consider a \RPN $(P,T, A, A_V, B, F)$, a state $\state{M}{H}$, and a transition $t$.
		We say that $t$ is \emph{reverse-enabled} in $\state{M}{H}$ if (1)  $H(t)\neq 0$, and (2)
		there exists a surjective function 
		$W:\effects{t}\cap A_V\rightarrow  A_I$ such that:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  for all
			$v\in\effects{t}$, if $\type(v) = a$
			then $\type(W(v))=a$, 
			\item for all $a\in F(t,x)$, then $W(a)\in M(x)$ and for all $(a,b)\in F(t,x)$, then $(W(a),W(b))\in M(x)$, 
			\item  for all $(a,b)\in \guard{t} - \effects{t}$ then $(W(a),W(b))\not\in M(x)$ for all $x\in\circ t$.
		\end{enumerate}
}\end{definition}

Thus, a transition $t$ is reverse-enabled in $\state{M}{H}$ if  
(1) the transition has been executed and (2) there exists a type-respecting assignment of token instances,
from the instances in the out-places of the transition, to the variables on the outgoing
edges of the transition, and where the instances are connected with bonds as required by
the transition's outgoing edges.  
We refer to $W$ as a reversal enabling assignment.
To implement the reversal of a transition $t$ according to a reversal enabling assignment $W$, 
the selected instances are relocated from  the outgoing places of the transition to the incoming places,
as specified
by the incoming arcs of the transition, with bonds created and destructed accordingly:

\begin{definition}\label{causal}{\rm
		Given a \RPN $(P,T, A, A_V, B, F)$, 
		a state $\langle M, H\rangle$, and a transition $t$ reverse-enabled in $\state{M}{H}$  with 
		$W$ a reversal enabling assignment, we write $ \state{M}{H}
		\rtrans{t} \state{M'}{H'}$   where for all $x$:
		\[
		M'(x) =   M(x)- \bigcup_{a\in f(t,x)} \connected(W(a), M(x)) 
		\cup  \bigcup_{a\in f(x,t),W(a)\in M(y))} \connected(W(a),S)\]
		where $S= (M(y)
		-\{(W(a),W(b))\mid (a,b)\in F(t,y)\})\cup \{ (W(a),W(b))\mid (a,b)\in F(x,t) \})$
		\[
		\hspace{0.3in}\mbox{and}\hspace{0.3in}
		H'(t') = \left\{
		\begin{array}{ll}
		H(t') - 1, \hspace{0.3cm} \;\;\textrm{ if } t' = t  \; \\
		H(t'),\hspace{1cm}  \;\textrm{ otherwise }
		\end{array}
		\right.
		\]
}\end{definition}	

We now return to the RPN autoprotolysis model and in Fig.~\ref{execution} we present
a possible execution of the model. The first net in this sequence shows the system after 
the execution of transition $t_1$ with enabling assignment $U(h)=H_1, U(o)=O_1$. Note
that the term $[1]$ written over transition $t_1$ captures that at this point $H(t_1)=1$ 
since the transition has been executed once.
This notation is generally used for histories in the graphical representation with occasional
missing histories corresponding to histories equal to $0$.
Subsequently,
we have the model after execution of transition $t_2$ with enabling assignment $U(h)=H_2,
U(o)=O_1$, creating the bond $O_1-H_2$, thus forming the first water molecule. A second
execution of transitions $t_1$ and $t_2$ results in the second molecule of water in the system,
placed again at place $y$, as shown in the third net in the figure. At this state, transition
$t_3$ is forward-enabled and,  with enabling assignment $U(o_1)=O_1, U(o_2)=O_2, U(h_1)=H_1, 
U(h_2)=H_2,U(h_3)=H_3,U(h_4)=H_4$, we have the creation of the hydronium and hydroxide
depicted at place $z$ in the fourth net of the figure. At this stage  transition $t_3$ is
now reverse-enabled and the last net in the figure illustrates the state resulting after
reversing $t_3$ with reversal enabling assignment $W(o_1)=O_1, W(o_2)=O_2, W(h_1)=H_1, 
W(h_2)=H_3,W(h_3)=H_2,W(h_4)=H_4$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Conclusion.} As we have shown, RPNs are a graphical
formalism well-suited to model chemical reactions such
as the autoprotolysis of water. At the same time, they are amenable for modeling
other types of distributed systems and they have been used successfully for
the modeling of a transaction-processing system~\cite{RPNs}, and a novel antenna selection  algorithm~\cite{CRPNs}. Their extension in~\cite{CRPNs} also introduces
a mechanism for controlling reversibility. This control is
enforced with the aid of conditions associated with transitions, whose satisfaction/violation
acts as a guard for the transition execution in the forward/backward direction, respectively. 
The conditions are enunciated within a simple logical language expressing properties 
relating to available tokens, and 
may capture environmental or other conditions that determine a transition's
reversal, e.g., changes in temperature. In future work, we plan to exploit recent work
that establishes a translation of a subclass of RPNs to coloured Petri nets~\cite{RPNtoCPN} towards
the development of a methodology for the analysis of reversing Petri nets exploiting
available tools.
